# Micro Frontends Summary

## What are Micro Frontends?

Micro Frontends is an architectural style that extends the concepts of microservices to the frontend. It allows teams to develop, deploy, and scale frontend applications independently. Each team can choose its technology stack, enabling flexibility and innovation.

## Key Principles

1. **Independence**: Each micro frontend is developed and deployed independently, allowing teams to work autonomously.
2. **Technology Agnostic**: Teams can use different frameworks and libraries, such as React, Angular, or Vue.js, within the same application.
3. **Composition**: Micro frontends are composed into a single application, often using techniques like iframes, web components, or JavaScript bundling.

## Applications

- **Large Scale Applications**: Ideal for large applications where multiple teams work on different features.
- **Legacy System Integration**: Helps in gradually migrating legacy applications to modern frameworks without a complete rewrite.
- **Experimentation**: Teams can experiment with new technologies or features without affecting the entire application.

## Benefits

- **Scalability**: Teams can scale their parts of the application independently.
- **Faster Development**: Parallel development leads to quicker releases.
- **Improved Maintainability**: Smaller codebases are easier to manage and understand.
